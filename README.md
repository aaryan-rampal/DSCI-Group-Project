# Final Project for DSCI 100

This is a group project that was submitted for our data science 100 course. 

By using the `cleveland.data` dataset provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease), we determined which variables we can use to accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease. 

This was done using `tidymodels` in R and it resulted in a model with an accuracy of 59% which had improved upon the majority classifier by 5%.
